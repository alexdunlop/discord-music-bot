# discord-music-bot
This is a bot written in javascript/node which may let users play music assuming the "discord-player-youtubei" dependency is working. The code was generated by ChatGPT and I suspect some of the code (especially that around playdl and ffmpeg) may be non-functional or unnecessary, as an ealier version of the code didn't include it and the bot was seemingly functional.
## features/commands
play (query/URL), stop, skip, pause, resume, queue, nowplaying, shuffle, help
## known issues
There is a popping sound during audio playback
## setup
- .env file needs to be populated with values for the Discord token and Youtube cookie
- Create environment and ensure node and associated packages are installed
